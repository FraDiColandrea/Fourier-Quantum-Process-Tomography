By Francesco Di Colandrea, University of Ottawa, 2024. See https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13458 for more details.

The folder "Data" contains the raw experimental data collected for the 1D and 2D complex polarization transformations considered in the paper. 

The Wolfram Mathematica notebook "FQPT.nb" imports the data and performs Fourier Quantum Process Tomography, using the parameters specified in the paper.
